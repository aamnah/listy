# Bootstrap for React Native projects

[GIST](https://gist.github.com/aamnah/4cd9f92bde643840939dcd8ffba7eed1/)

Following are the packages and configs that i use almost every time, so combining them here as a gist for quick reference. May even make a Bash script out of it at some point

- Typescript support
- React Navigation
- Redux and Redux Toolkit
- Styled Components
- ESLint config (sorted import statements, don't overwrite Prettier rules)
- Prettier config
- Tyepscript config ([custom path mapping](https://reactnative.dev/docs/typescript#using-custom-path-aliases-with-typescript))
